# Quantum_Computing_Epigenesys
Quantum Computing course on behalf of Epigenesys s.r.l. 

## Context
The course took place between October and November 2023 at the Epigenesys s.r.l. office for one of their clients. It was delivered in a hybrid mode, with some clients following the lectures through the BBB platform from their own office.

The course was held by me (Sara Galatro) and a university colleague (Lorenzo Gasparini). Our work was supervised by the University of Roma Tre Professor Marco Pedicini.

## Content
In this repository you can find:
* my LaTeX notes (in pdf format) on the mathematical introduction, notions of quantum mechanics, probabilistic systems and quantum systems (basically, Day1 of the course)
* PowerPoint presentations (in pdf format) of the given lectures;
* Jupyter Notebooks containing the various implementations in Qiskit;
* the Bibliography file (in pdf format)

The course was delivered in Italian, hence all the material is in Italian too.
