# Quantum_Computing_Epigenesys
Quantum Computing course on behalf of Epigenesys s.r.l. 

## Context
The course took place between October and November 2023 at the Epigenesys s.r.l. office for one of their clients. It was delivered in a hybrid mode, with some clients following the lectures through the BBB platform from their own office.

The course was held by me (Sara Galatro) and a university colleague (Lorenzo Gasparini). Our work was supervised by the University of Roma Tre Professor Marco Pedicini.

## Content
In this repository you can find:
* my LaTeX notes (in pdf format) on the mathematical introduction, notions of quantum mechanics, probabilistic systems and quantum systems (basically, Day1 of the course);
* my LaTeX notes (in pdf format) on Grover's Algorithm;
* PowerPoint presentations (in pdf format) of the given lectures;
* Jupyter Notebooks containing the various implementations in Qiskit;
* the Bibliography file (in pdf format);
* the final program (in pdf format).

The course was delivered in Italian, hence all the material is in Italian too.

## Additional notes
The notes and the notebooks have been written/coded by me using the references cited in the Bibliography file, whilist the presentations were created by both Lorenzo and me (based on the topics we were each presenting).

On the last day, we also used various Qiskit and Ocean notebooks to show a few examples and how to use the platforms (both IBM Quantum and Leap), but we did not act on any of their content, hence they are not uploaded in this repository.
